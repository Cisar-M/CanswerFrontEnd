  <h1>About lung cancer lung cancer</h1>
  <p>Lung cancer, is caused by abnormality in the body's basic unit of life, the cell.
    <br>The body maintains a system of checks and balances on cell growth so that cells divide to produce new cells growth so the cells divide 
    <br>to produce new cells,d isruption of this system of checks and balance cell growth when neccessary. results in an uncontrolled division and proliferation of cells 
    <br>that eventually forms a mass known as a tumor.

  <h1>Lung cancer statistics</h1>
   <p>According to the NCI:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The changes of developing lung cancer increases with age</li>
    <li>More than 90% of all new lung cancer cases are diagonesed in people who are above the age of 55</li>
    <li>Men are at a higher risk of developing lung cancer than women </li>

  <h1>Diagnosing lung cancer</h1>
  <p>
    Diagnostic tools for lung cancer are used not only to identify and stage the cancer, but to help identify treatment options and monitor progress during treatments. Diagnostic procedures may include: </p>
     <ul>
      <li>-X-ray</li>
      
      <li>Lab tests, including advanced genomic testing</li>
     
      <li>Biopsy</li>
      
      <li>CT scan, CT angiogram and PET/CT scan</li>
     
      <li>Autofluorescence, navigation and/or robotic bronchoscopy</li>
    </ul> 
  <h1>Types of lung cancer of lung cancer</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Non small cell lung cancers:</strong> most common type of lung cancer. It accounts for nearly nine out of every 10 cases.
      usually grows at a slower rate</li>
      <br>
    <li><strong>small cell lung cancer:</strong>  starts in the bronchi, then quickly grows and spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes.
    This type of lung cancer represents fewer than 20 percent of lung cancers and is typically caused by tobacco smoking.</li>
  </ul>
